Preprocessing of ocean bottom seismic data
Obstools is an extensive Python package that serves as a comprehensive toolbox for processing ocean bottom seismic and pressure data. It offers a range of preprocessing capabilities, including decimation, glitches removal, removal of local and global earthquakes, tilt correction utilizing three distinct approaches, pressure gauge calibration, and water attraction correction. Moreover, the toolbox provides flexibility by granting access to and allowing modifications to various signal processing methods such as different types of filters, tapering, and numerous useful plots for data analysis.

Despite its user-friendly nature, obstools employs sophisticated calculations and methodologies to ensure highly accurate results. By incorporating intricate techniques, this toolbox ensures the precision and reliability of the processed data.
